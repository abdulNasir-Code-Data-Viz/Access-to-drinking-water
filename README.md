# Access-to-drinking-water
In this  project, I investigated the access to safe and affordable drinking water focussing on inequalities in service levels between different countries and regions

# Project Overview
UNITED NATIONS SDGs: Overview
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are an ongoing global call to action to end poverty, ensure
prosperity and peace for all people, and protect our planet.
There are 17 goals relating to poverty, health, education, basic services, inequality, climate, peace,
and partnership.

# UN SDG 6
# United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 : Clean water and sanitation
Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all

Due to changes in our climate, droughts are becoming more prevalent and water supplies are decreasing
worldwide. This not only affects access to drinking water but also sanitation and hygiene which often results in unnecessary diseases and death.
In order to ensure greater access to water and sanitation, communities across the world need to assist each other in developing and managing water resources.

# Data Source : WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (JMP)
The JMP dataset estimates household access to drinking water services between 2000 and
2020 to assess progress toward achieving the sixth SDG.

# Analysis of the data 
1. Using Google Sheets
2. Gathering insights,
3. Answering the questions regarding access to
safe and affordable drinking water

# Acitivities
1. Importing and cleaning data,
2. Creating new features 
3. Visualisations
4. nterpretation of the results.

# Questions Answered

● How does the urban population share compare to the rural population?
● What is the tendency and spread of the different water access features?
● How do these measures of water access compare across different types of areas?
● What does the national access to water look like based on national population size?
● What does the urban access to water look like based on urban population size?
● What does the rural access look like?
● What is the effect of national population size and urbanisation on GNI and water access?
● How does the imported dataset differ from the Estimates on the use of water (2020) dataset?
● Which years are represented within the dataset?
● What is the average year difference per country?
● What is the Annual Rates Change (ARC) for the national, rural, and urban areas per country?
● What is the average of the different ARCs for all countries?
● How does access to basic water change over time for different areas?
● How does the ARC differ between rural and urban populations?
● How does the ARC compare across different regions?
● How does the national population size influence the ARC?
